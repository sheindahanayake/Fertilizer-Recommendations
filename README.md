# ML Fertilizer Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based fertilizer recommendation system that provides optimal fertilizer suggestions for different crops based on soil conditions, environmental factors, and crop type. The model uses historical agricultural data to predict the best fertilizer types, quantities, and application methods for improving crop yield.

## Features
- **Fertilizer Prediction**: Recommends the most suitable fertilizers for a specific crop based on soil quality and environmental factors.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: The system uses real-world data to improve recommendations, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Users can enter their specific crop type, soil properties, and location to receive personalized fertilizer advice.
- **Model Training**: Trained on historical agricultural data to predict the best fertilizer formulas.

## Installation

To run the fertilizer recommendation system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Fertilizer-Recommendation.git
   cd ML-Fertilizer-Recommendation
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset (instructions for this will be provided in the [Data](#data) section).

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Example Input
You will be prompted to enter the following details:
- Crop Type: E.g., "Wheat", "Rice", "Corn"
- Soil pH Level: E.g., "6.5"
- Soil Nitrogen Content: E.g., "Low", "Medium", "High"
- Soil Phosphorus and Potassium Levels
- Weather Conditions (if applicable)

Once entered, the system will provide fertilizer recommendations, including:
- Fertilizer Type (e.g., Organic, NPK)
- Recommended Quantity (e.g., "50kg per hectare")
- Application Method (e.g., "Broadcasting")

### Example Output
```
For Crop: Wheat
- Fertilizer Type: NPK 10-20-10
- Recommended Quantity: 50 kg per hectare
- Application Method: Broadcasting before sowing
```

## Data
The system uses agricultural data collected from various regions and crops, including soil health indicators, weather conditions, and crop type. To use the system, download the dataset from the following sources:

- [Dataset Link](https://example.com/dataset)

Ensure the data is in the format specified in the `data/` folder, where each row contains:
- Crop Type
- Soil pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium Levels
- Environmental Factors (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall)
- Yield Data (for training purposes)

## Model

The model is a **Random Forest** classifier, trained using the historical agricultural data. The training process involves:
1. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from soil and environmental data.
2. Model Training: Using cross-validation techniques to train the model on various feature sets.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model for better accuracy.

### Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using common metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
